# pdbe-images
Generates images from mmCIF/BCIF files


## Testing

```sh
npm run jest
```

Note: Current version of ts-jest (29.1.0) doesn't work perfectly with TypeScript 5.0 (wrong source map, i.e. the Jest error message will point to a different place in code than where the error really comes from).
